# Video Call Architecture

## Overview
SaleFlow's video calling system is built on WebRTC technology, enabling peer-to-peer video communication with fallback to TURN servers when necessary.

## Components

### 1. Frontend WebRTC Stack
- Media capture (getUserMedia)
- PeerConnection management
- DataChannel for metadata
- Screen sharing (getDisplayMedia)
- Local recording capabilities
- Bandwidth and quality management

### 2. Signaling Server
- WebSocket-based communication
- SDP exchange facilitation
- ICE candidate distribution
- Room management
- Participant tracking
- Connection state management

### 3. STUN/TURN Infrastructure
- STUN servers for NAT traversal
- TURN servers for fallback relay
- Geographic distribution for low latency
- Automatic server selection
- Connection quality monitoring

### 4. Recording Service
- Server-side recording
- Real-time transcoding
- Cloud storage integration
- Automatic backup
- Access control

## Implementation Details

### 1. Connection Flow
1. Client requests to join room
2. Server authenticates and returns room token
3. Client connects to signaling WebSocket
4. Client creates RTCPeerConnection
5. Signaling server coordinates SDP exchange
6. ICE candidates are exchanged
7. Media streams are established

### 2. Quality Management
- Adaptive bitrate control
- Network quality monitoring
- Automatic quality adjustment
- Bandwidth estimation
- Connection health metrics

### 3. Fallback Mechanisms
- ICE restart on connection failure
- TURN server fallback
- Automatic reconnection
- Quality degradation handling
- Error recovery

### 4. Security Measures
- End-to-end encryption
- DTLS-SRTP for media
- Secure signaling
- Room access control
- Recording permissions

## Third-party Services

### Required Services
1. STUN/TURN Server Options:
   - Twilio Network Traversal Service
   - CoTURN (self-hosted)
   - Google STUN servers (free tier)

2. Recording & Storage:
   - Amazon S3 for storage
   - FFmpeg for transcoding
   - Redis for temporary storage

3. Monitoring:
   - WebRTC stats API
   - Custom metrics collection
   - Performance monitoring

## Scaling Considerations

### 1. Infrastructure
- Geographic distribution of TURN servers
- Load balancing for signaling servers
- Recording service scalability
- Storage optimization

### 2. Performance
- Connection quality monitoring
- Bandwidth optimization
- CPU/Memory usage tracking
- Client-side performance metrics

### 3. Cost Optimization
- TURN server usage optimization
- Recording storage management
- Bandwidth usage monitoring
- Resource allocation strategies
